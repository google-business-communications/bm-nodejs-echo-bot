# BUSINESS MESSAGES: Echo Bot

This sample demonstrates how to use the [Business Messages Node.js client library](https://github.com/google-business-communications/nodejs-businessmessages) for performing operations
with the [Business Messages API](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/reference/rest).

This sample contains multiple example codebases. Each subfolder
is a complete example bot and can be deployed to Google App Engine
to support a Business Messages conversational experience.

This application assumes that you're signed up with
[Business Messages](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register).
